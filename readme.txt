WP Template Overrides allows you to quickly and easily override any template file in any theme you currently have installed.

== Description ==

No more do you need to create a child theme (And take the risk of it breaking the website) or modify a premium theme (Losing the ability to quickly and easily update in the future) just to tweak a theme template.

WP Template Override allows you to quickly and easily override any template file in any theme you currently have installed.

Once the plugin is installed, choose the theme, and then the file you wish to override, and edit it in the included code editor.
Pressing save will activate the override and you will be able to see the changes immediately.
